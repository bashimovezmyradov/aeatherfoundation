    <p>
      We support all social classes, the system is rigged against us, so we became the system.
    </p>
    <p>
            Everyday people are pitted against eachother without any assistance whatsoever, so we offer our aid to those in need

<p> We at the Aeather Foundation follow a simple but effect line of morals<br>
    <br> 1. We always follow the agenda </br>
    <br> 2. No man left behind </br>
    <br> 3. If you think the government wouldn't do it, yes they would</p>
 



 
</p>
<p>
     We are a family, looking to help unfortunate people who have potenial to grow into something bigger than were they are at right now but restricted due to social class.
</p>

<br>

<br>
<p> The Aeather Foundation is an organization specialized in helping the unfortunate. Due to our own personal experiences we would like to give back to the community we grew up in, by offering our services.</p>
